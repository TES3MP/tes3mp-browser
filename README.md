TES3MP Server Browser
=====================
This is the 2nd generation of the server browser, using the 3rd implementation of the Master Server protocol.
The browser's code base has been separated from the main TES3MP repo, which means it is now independent from TES3MP versions.

The Master Server Protocol v3 is licensed under the MIT License, but the master server currently does not have an open source implementation.

Requirements
------------
* C++ compiler with C++17 support
* CMake 3.5 or higher
* QT5 (Core, Widgets, Network, WebSockets)
* Boost (System, File System, Program Options)
* CrabNet (https://github.com/TES3MP/CrabNet)
